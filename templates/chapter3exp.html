              Important habitability factors include temperature, pressure, lighting, noise, and amount of space. It is essential that astronauts get the food, sleep, and exercise they need to stay healthy and happy. Technology, as is often the case with off-world exploration, comes to the rescue in creating a livable home in a harsh environment. Everything is monitored, from air quality to potential microbial inhabitants. Microorganisms that live naturally in your body are more easily transferred from one person to another in a closed environment. Astronauts also contribute data points through urine and blood samples, and can reveal valuable information about potential stressors.

              An interesting effect of radiation is its induced hyperthermia and hypothermia, which are mediated centrally, but by different neurotransmitters or mediators, such as histamine or prostaglandins, since HZE particles are capable of inducing biphasic changes in body temperature. . Extensive recycling of resources that we take for granted is also imperative: oxygen, water, carbon dioxide, even our waste.

              Exposure to an environment of microgravity alters the distribution of body fluids and the degree of distention of the cranial veins, and these changes are consequently capable of causing structural remodeling and altering brain autoregulation. The absence of pumping mechanisms and the presence of one-way venous valves in the head, neck, and upper thorax require gravitational assistance to drain the blood. In space, a slight increase in pressure on the venous and dural sinuses as a consequence of stasis, obstructs the resorption of cerebrospinal fluid through the arachnoid villi, raising the pressure of this fluid. In addition, there is a decrease in lymphatic drainage, which results in epicranial edema. The uniform elevation of intracranial pressure causes anatomical distortion, but this is limited to areas in which the Central Nervous System is not completely protected by the cranial vault, such as the foramen magnum or the area distal to the optic canal, where it is originate pressure gradients. In the orbital compartment, this will manifest as an expansion of the dural layer, crushing of the posterior globe, and papilledema or "papillary protrusion.
