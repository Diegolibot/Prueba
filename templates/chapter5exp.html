              <br><br>
              The cardiovascular system has the ability to adapt to microgravity conditions. The adaptation mechanisms carried out by this system are determined according to the stage or phase of flight, height, etc. The most important and significant alteration is the redistribution of fluids towards the brain territory, which conditions cardiac overload and increased intravascular pressure. The most important and significant alteration is the redistribution of fluids towards the brain territory, which conditions cardiac overload and increased intravascular pressure. It seems clear that cardiac strain occurs during the first 1-2 days of spaceflight relative to the supine position at 1 G and especially at 1 G vertical conditions. It is also likely that the arterial baroreceptors are relatively stimulated during this time and that the intracranial pressure increases abnormally.

                ISS Expedition 44 crew members first got a taste of space-grown food when they harvested a red romaine lettuce planted as part of NASA's Veg-01 plant experiment. When choosing the plants to grow, a number of factors are taken into account, such as nutritional value and yield. Two first candidates are potatoes and "dwarf wheat". Both are high-calorie carbohydrate foods, so they can provide astronauts with enough energy to last a long mission. They are also robust plants that adapt to most conditions on Earth and provide high yields without taking up too much space to grow. Plants are not useful in space only as a source of food: astronauts also hope to use them to create a self-sufficient circuit capable of supplying them with all the oxygen, water and food they need without any replenishment from Earth. For more than 25 years, the European Space Agency (ESA) has been working to achieve this goal with its “Micro-ecological Alternative Life Support System” (MELiSSA) program. The project aims to perfect a life-sustaining system that can be transported into space. Human waste (such as urine and exhaled carbon dioxide) would supply the plants with essential ingredients for their growth, and in turn, the plants will provide oxygen and food for humans, as well as filter wastewater.
                Plants that grow weightless are weaker, longer, and with thinner stems. They produce fewer rigid support elements, such as lignin, because they do not need it.
